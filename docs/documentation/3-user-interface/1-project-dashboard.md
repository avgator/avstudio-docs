# Project Dashboard Overview

The Project Dashboard in AVstudio allows you to manage and interact with individual project environments, previews, and settings. This section explains the layout and functionality of each part of the interface so you can confidently preview, configure, and manage your project.

## Navigating the Project Dashboard

The interface offers both **live and build previews**, **environment toggles**, and access to project-specific settings and controls. Below is a breakdown of the numbered elements in the Project Dashboard image.

### Project Dashboard Elements

üëâ Here's what each numbered element in the image does:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **‚ë† Live Preview Selector** | Shows the current live preview environment (e.g., Default, Developers, Onsite, iPad). Clicking the icon opens a dropdown to select a different environment to preview. |
| **‚ë° Build Preview Selector** | Similar to the live preview, this allows you to choose which **build environment** you want to view. Useful for comparing builds against different configuration targets. |
| **‚ë¢ Settings Menu** | Opens a dropdown with additional project-level options, including **Project Settings**, **Clone Project**, and **Delete Project**. |
| **‚ë£ Project Settings** | Takes you to a more detailed settings area where you can configure project metadata, variables, containers, and more. |
| **‚ë§ Clone Project** | Creates a copy of the current project. Ideal for creating variants or backups without starting from scratch. |
| **‚ë• Delete Project** | Permanently deletes the current project. ‚ö†Ô∏è This action is irreversible. |
| **‚ë¶ Active Environment Display** | Reflects the currently selected environment from item ‚ë†. This is where you can verify which environment is being previewed at a glance. |
| **‚ëß Save Project** | Click here to save any unsaved changes made to your project configuration, content, or layout. Always save before exiting or previewing. |
| **‚ë® Open Live Preview** | An alternate access point to launch a full-screen live preview of your project in the selected environment. |

:::tip Notes
- Use the **Live Preview Selector (‚ë†)** to quickly jump between environments like "Default" or "Developers".
- Always click **Save Project (‚ëß)** after making any changes to ensure they‚Äôre stored before previewing or navigating away.
