![AVstudio Global Containers](./img/avstudio-globalcontainers.png)

Global containers are areas where you can place any elements and by
default they will be displayed on all pages of your project. This is
convenient for positioning headers, persistent menus, as well as other
content that should be presented globally.

Within this section of global containers management, you can:

| Name | Change global container Name |
| -------- | -------- |
| Position | Global container position based on device orientation |
|Visible on Pages|Partial visibility based on active page|
|Hidden on Pages | Partial visibility based on active page|
|Visible by default|Global container default visibility toggle|
|Actions | Remove Global container |
