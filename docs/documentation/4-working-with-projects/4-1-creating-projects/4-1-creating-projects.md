# How to Create a Project

There are several ways to start a project in AVstudio. You can create a new one from scratch, duplicate an existing project, or start with a template. This guide walks you through each option.

## Create a New Project from Scratch

To start fresh:

- Click the `+ New Project` button in the top-right corner of your dashboard.
- In the `Create New Project` window:
  - Enter your desired `project name`
  - Choose a `theme` from the dropdown menu
- Click `Add new project` to finish.

## Clone an Existing Project

You can duplicate any of your existing projects as a starting point.

- Go to the `My Projects` panel
- Hover over a project and click the `â˜°` (hamburger) menu
- Select `Clone Project`

## Use Community or Personal Templates

You can also create a new project by cloning a predefined template.

### Clone a Community Template

- Expand the `Community Templates` section in the sidebar
- Select a template
- Click `Clone to my Projects`

### Clone a Personal Template

- Expand the `My Templates` section (if available)
- Select a saved template
- Click `Clone to my Projects`

:::tip Note
This works the same way as community templates, and you can rename the project after cloning.

## Summary
