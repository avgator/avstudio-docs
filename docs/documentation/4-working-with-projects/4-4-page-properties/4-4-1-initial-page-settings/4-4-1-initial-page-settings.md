# Initial Page Settings

When you open a page in the editor, AVstudio automatically loads the Page Properties view. This is where you configure the basic identity and behavior of the page before adding content or containers.

## What Are Page Properties?

Page Properties define the foundational characteristics of your page. These settings influence how your page is identified, behaves within the project, and adapts to layout rules.

ðŸ‘‰ Use Page Properties to:

- Set the page name and internal identifier  
- Define layout types (adaptive or responsive)  
- Control toolbar visibility and page-specific settings  
- Adjust spacing and container behavior

## Accessing the Page Properties View

As soon as a page is opened in the editor, the Page Properties panel appears by default.

ðŸ‘‰ To manually access it later:

- Open the desired page in the editor  
- Click the **Page Properties** icon in the right-hand panel

## Page Parameters Overview

Below is a summary of the key properties you can configure:

| Parameter            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Page Name            | Visible label for the page in the project navigator                         |
| Internal ID          | Unique identifier used for linking or referencing the page programmatically |
| Layout Type          | Choose between Adaptive or Responsive layout behavior                       |
| Toolbar Visibility   | Show or hide the editor toolbar on this page                                |
| Default Container Gap| Adjust spacing between containers on the page                               |

:::tip Note
You can change most of these settings at any time, even after adding content to your page.

## Editing Page Properties

When you open a page in the editor, AVstudio automatically loads the **Page Properties** view. This is where you configure the basic identity and behavior of the page before adding content or containers.

![Page Properties View](./img/page-name-and-classname.png)

ðŸ‘‰ The editor opens with the `Page Properties` tab selected in the left panel. This is the default view when editing a new page.

ðŸ‘‰ Click the `page name` field in the upper-right corner to rename your page. Choose a name that reflects the screen's purpose in your interface.  
*Example: `LobbyScreen`, `LightingControl`, or `UserSettings`*

ðŸ‘‰ Use the `page CSS class name` field below the page name to assign a custom class for styling. This is optional, but helpful if you plan to apply specific CSS rules.  
*Example: `dashboard-dark` or `main-layout-responsive`*

ðŸ‘‰ After making changes, click the `Save project` button in the top-right to apply your updates.


In the next section, weâ€™ll walk through the toolbar options available while editing a page, including layout orientation, device preview, zoom, and connection settings.

## Toolbar Options While Editing a Page

When you're working inside the AVstudio page editor, you'll find a row of toolbar options that help you adjust layout, simulate devices, toggle views, and manage connections. This section covers each of those options, starting from left to right.

### View Controls

The `View` control lets you manage layout guides that assist with alignment and structure inside the canvas.

![View controls](./img/view-controls.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Click the `View` button to open the layout guide dropdown.

ðŸ‘‰ Toggle `Show Guides` to display alignment guides directly on the canvas. These help you position elements consistently.

ðŸ‘‰ Toggle `Display Guides Positions` to show exact pixel values for each guide, useful for precision layout.

ðŸ‘‰ Use `Lock Guides` to prevent accidental changes to guide placement.

ðŸ‘‰ When enabled, `Delete all Guides` clears all layout guides from the editor in one action.

### Test Device Selector

The test device selector allows you to preview how your page will appear on different screen sizes. It doesn't affect the final build â€” itâ€™s just a helpful way to test layouts during editing.

![Device selector](./img/device-selector.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Click the device name in the toolbar (e.g., `iPad Mini`) to open the selector menu.

ðŸ‘‰ Choose from the list of predefined devices such as:
- `iPad Mini (1024 Ã— 768)`
- `iPad Pro (1366 Ã— 1024)`
- `TSW (1280 Ã— 800)`

ðŸ‘‰ If you want to preview on a custom device, enter a `Name`, `Width`, and `Height` under the **My devices** section.

ðŸ‘‰ Click `Add device` to save your custom option. It will appear under **My devices** for reuse.


This feature is useful for checking how adaptive or responsive layouts behave on various screen dimensions. More preview and layout tools are covered next.

### Orientation Toggle

The orientation toggle allows you to switch the canvas view between portrait and landscape. This is especially useful when designing for devices that may rotate or be mounted differently.

![Orientation toggle](./img/orientation-control.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Click the rotation icon in the toolbar to switch between `Portrait` and `Landscape` orientation.

ðŸ‘‰ The canvas will update instantly to reflect the new layout, helping you test how elements respond to changes in screen direction.

Use this toggle to preview how your design will behave across different mounting setups or user interactions. This is particularly helpful for responsive layouts or kiosk installations.

### Zoom Controls

The zoom control lets you adjust how much of the canvas is visible while editing. This can help when working on detailed layouts or when you want a full-page overview.

![Zoom controls](./img/zoom-control.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Click the zoom percentage (e.g. `100%`) to open the zoom settings.

ðŸ‘‰ Use the slider or input box to manually set the zoom level.

ðŸ‘‰ Click `Fit` to resize the canvas to fit the screen.

ðŸ‘‰ Click `Center` to recenter the canvas if it has shifted.

ðŸ‘‰ Click `Reset` to return to 100% zoom instantly.

These controls are useful for navigating large or complex layouts with more precision while designing.

### Editor and Preview Toggle

The toolbar lets you switch between editing your page and previewing how it will look during runtime. This is helpful for testing layout, interactions, and visibility without leaving the editor.

![Editor and Preview toggle](./img/editor-preview-controls.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Click `Editor` to stay in edit mode, where you can update containers, properties, and layout elements.

ðŸ‘‰ Click `Preview` to simulate the live version of the page and see how it behaves without needing to build or publish.

Preview mode is great for spot-checking animations, positioning, and interactions before committing changes.

### Connection Manager

The `Connection Manager` lets you simulate how your page interacts with connected systems. This is useful for testing signal routing and verifying dynamic behaviors during development.

![Connection Manager](./img/connection-manager.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Open the `Connection Manager` from the toolbar (look for the chain-link icon near the right side). Depending on the connection state, the label may say `Connected` or `Disconnected`.

ðŸ‘‰ Use the `Toggle connections` switch to simulate connecting or disconnecting from the system.

ðŸ‘‰ Any WebSocket connectors will appear in the **WebSocket Connections** section, if available.

Use this tool to test logic that depends on real-time connections, without deploying to actual hardware.

### Show/Hide Console

The `Show/Hide Console` button lets you open a live debug panel directly inside the editor. This panel appears on the right-hand side of the screen and helps you monitor signals, parameter values, and system interactions in real time.

![Show Console](./img/show-console.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Click the console icon in the upper-right toolbar to toggle the debug console. Youâ€™ll find it next to the Connection Manager icon.

ðŸ‘‰ When enabled, the console opens along the right edge of the editor. Youâ€™ll see logs related to page activity, signal changes, and dynamic behaviors.

ðŸ‘‰ Click the icon again to hide the panel and return to a cleaner editing view.

Use this tool while testing parameter logic, custom interactions, or integration behaviors. Itâ€™s especially useful when verifying changes without leaving the editor.

### Undo and Redo Actions

The editor provides undo and redo icons so you can easily revert or repeat recent changes.

![Undo and Redo icons](./img/undo-redo.png)

ðŸ‘‰ **Undo icon** â€“ Reverts your most recent change  
ðŸ‘‰ **Redo icon** â€“ Re-applies the last undone action

These tools are useful when experimenting with layout or design settings, helping you quickly fix mistakes or test alternatives with confidence.

## Working with Page Parameters

Page parameters allow you to store and pass dynamic values to a page. These values can be referenced throughout the pageâ€™s logic â€” for example, to control visibility, pass user input, or trigger conditional behavior. You can define parameters like booleans, numbers, or strings depending on what your layout needs.

### Adding a Page Parameter

When you open a page in the editor, youâ€™ll see two tabs at the top: `Editor` and `Parameters`. Click the `Parameters` tab to view and manage any page-specific parameters.

![Page Parameters](./img/create-parameter-modal.png)

1. Click the `Parameters` tab beside `Editor` in the page editor view.  
2. Click the `Add Page Parameter` button to open the Create Subpage Parameter modal.  
3. In the `Name` field, enter a unique identifier for the parameter.  
   *Example: `showWelcomeMessage` or `userRole`*  
4. Under `Type`, select the kind of value the parameter will store:
   - `Boolean` â€“ true or false  
   - `String` â€“ any text value  
   - `Number` â€“ numeric values  
5. Enter a `Default Value` that will be used when the page first loads.  
6. Enable the `Format output value` checkbox if you want to transform the parameter before it's used.  
7. If formatting is enabled, use the `Format value with function` field to choose how the value will be processed.  
   *Example: You could apply a function to change "on" to "ON", or round a number.*  
8. Click `Create Parameter` to finish.


### Why Use Page Parameters?

Parameters make your pages interactive and dynamic. You can use them to:

- **Toggle visibility** â€“ Show or hide elements based on a `Boolean` value.  
- **Pass data** â€“ Use `String` parameters to move text values between screens.  
- **Trigger logic** â€“ Apply conditions based on `Number` or `String` values for flow control.

Think of parameters as live, local variables that let your pages react to user input, logic conditions, or connection events.
