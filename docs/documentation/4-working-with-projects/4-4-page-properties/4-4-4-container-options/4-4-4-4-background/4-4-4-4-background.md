# Background Settings in Container Options

The `Background` section lets you customize how a container looks visually by adding background colors, blur effects, or images. These settings allow you to define the tone and depth of UI sections, making your layout feel more dynamic and styled.

## Default Options

When no background image is set, you can style your container using these options:

- **Background Elements Blur**  
  Apply a blur effect behind the content inside the container. This softens visuals and creates a sense of layering.

- **Background Color**  
  Click the square preview to open a color palette, or manually type a color value (e.g., `#F3F3F3` or `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`).

- **Toggle Custom Background Image**  
  Use this switch to enable advanced image settings. Turning this on allows you to insert an image from your media library or a URL.

**Example:** Use a soft gray background (`#F5F5F5`) with a slight blur to visually separate form sections from the main canvas.

## Custom Background Image

When custom image mode is enabled, you can display background visuals that support either branding, content reinforcement, or purely aesthetic design.

### Image Source

You can select an image in two main ways:

- **Library**
  - Pick a static image from your project's media library
  - Or toggle `Dynamic pick from library` to assign an image ID dynamically
  - Assign values via a variable, parameter, or state entry

- **URL**
  - Enter a direct link to an external image
  - Or assign a dynamic value through a variable, parameter, or state

**Example:** Use dynamic image loading for personalized dashboards or live content previews.

### Styling Options

After selecting your image, you'll see additional layout styling options:

- **Blur & Opacity**  
  Adjust these using sliders to fade or soften the background image.

- **Fill Type**
  - `Cover`: Fill the entire container while maintaining aspect ratio
  - `Contain`: Scale the image to fit within the container without cropping
  - `Fill`: Stretch the image to fill both width and height (may distort)
  - `Custom Size`: Enter specific width and height

- **Custom Size**
  - Set the backgroundâ€™s width and height in `%` or `px`
  - Supports dynamic assignment via variable, parameter, or state

**Example:** Use `Cover` for full-bleed background images or `Contain` for logos or branding marks.

- **Position**
  - Controls how the background image is placed inside the container
  - Options: `Center`, `Top`, `Bottom`, `Left`, `Right`

**Example:** Center a logo, or align decorative accents to the bottom corner of the container.

:::tip Note
Use `Custom Size` with `Position` to fine-tune image placement for responsive design. This is especially helpful for overlapping content or fixed layout structures.
