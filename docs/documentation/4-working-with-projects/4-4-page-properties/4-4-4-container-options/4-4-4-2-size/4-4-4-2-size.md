# Size Settings in Container Options

The `Size` section controls how much space the container uses on the page and how spacing behaves inside it. This is where you manage layout structure using either `Default` or `Manual` sizing, along with element spacing and padding.

Whether you're building a responsive layout or need pixel-precise control, the size settings help you define spacing that adapts—or locks in place—based on your needs.

## Default Mode

The `Default` mode offers flexible sizing that adapts to content and layout context. It’s the recommended choice when building responsive pages or working with dynamic content that may vary in size.

### Elements Gap

This setting defines the space between child elements inside the container.

- You can enter values in `%` or `px`
- Applies consistent spacing between each item

**Example:** Use a `24px` gap between navigation buttons or a `5%` gap between cards in a responsive grid.

### Padding Control

Padding adds internal space between the container’s edge and its contents.

You can define padding in two ways:

- **Fixed values**: Type a specific number using common units like `px`, `em`, `vh`, or `vw`
- **Dynamic values**: Click the dynamic icon (fx) to bind padding to a:
  - Variable
  - Parameter (custom value with type)
  - State entry (tied to UI behavior)

**Example:** Assign a padding of `32px` for larger screens, or bind it to a `containerPadding` parameter for layout flexibility across breakpoints.

### Show Advanced Padding

Enable this toggle to specify padding per side:

- Top
- Right
- Bottom
- Left

Each field supports both fixed and dynamic values.

**Example:** Use `0` for top/bottom padding but `16px` for left/right to align text with nearby UI elements.

## Manual Mode

Switching to `Manual` allows you to set the container’s actual size.

- Manually enter `Width` and `Height` using `%` or `px`
- Retains all other settings from Default mode (Elements Gap, Padding Control, Advanced Padding)

This is ideal for fixed layout zones or design systems where precise alignment is required.

**Example:** Set width to `300px` for a sidebar container or `100%` for a full-width banner block.

:::tip Note
Use `Default` mode for adaptive, fluid layouts that respond to screen size. Use `Manual` mode when your design needs exact dimensions that don’t change based on content.
