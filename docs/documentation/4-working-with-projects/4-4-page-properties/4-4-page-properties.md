# Page Properties

This article provides an overview of all the page-level settings available in AVstudio. These settings define how each page behaves, looks, and connects to other parts of your project. You can access all of them from the left-hand panel when a page is open in the editor.

## Overview of Available Settings

When a page is open, the left panel displays a list of page-specific and project-wide tools. These options allow you to control layout, background, containers, actions, styles, and assets.

ðŸ‘‰ Here's a breakdown of each section:

### Page Properties

Configure the page's identity and layout behavior.

- Set the `Page Name` and an optional `CSS Class Name`
- Choose layout type (adaptive or responsive)
- Control toolbar visibility and container spacing

### Alignment

Adjust element alignment using grid lines, padding, and snapping controls to keep designs structured and consistent.

### Global Containers

Access reusable containers that can be shared across pages (e.g., headers, footers, side menus).

### Page Containers

Add layout containers directly to the current page. These hold components and widgets and support nesting for more complex structures.

### Page Actions

Set up logic that runs when the page loads or changesâ€”ideal for triggering animations, setting variables, or navigating to other pages.

### Page Background

Customize the visual background of the page using:

- Solid colors
- Gradients
- Image assets

### Project Theme

Manage visual consistency across the entire project by defining color palettes, font styles, and theme behaviors.

### Project CSS

Write or paste custom CSS that applies to the entire project. Use this to override styles or define reusable utility classes.

### Project Media Library

Access all uploaded media files in one place. You can:

- Browse and search for assets
- Upload new files
- Reuse images across multiple screens
