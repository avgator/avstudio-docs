# Adding Elements to a Container

Each container in AVstudio can hold one or more elements. These elements define the actual content or controls inside your layout—such as buttons, sliders, inputs, or embedded widgets.

You can add both standard elements and advanced widgets depending on the type of interface you're building. Elements help create interactive UIs, while widgets provide higher-level functionality for media, automation, and custom display.

## How to Add an Element

*The New Element panel allows you to name and select the type of element you want to add.*

To insert a new element into a container:

1. Click the `Add Element` button under the container  
2. The **New Element** panel will open  
3. Enter a clear and descriptive **name** for your element  
   *Example: `SubmitButton`, `UserNameInput`, `MainSlider`*  
4. Choose the **element type** from the list  
5. Click `Add Element` to save

The element will now appear under the container’s `Elements` section where you can modify its properties.

## Available Element Types

### Standard Elements

These are the most common building blocks used in UI layouts.

| `Checkbox`       | Allows on/off toggling for binary options. Ideal for preferences or filters. |
| `Dpad`           | A directional control interface. Useful for navigation in kiosk or media layouts. |
| `Image`          | Displays a static image from your media library or a dynamic source.        |

### Widgets

Widgets are pre-built, functional components that offer more specialized or advanced features. Some widgets are **premium** and require a specific license to use.

| Widget Name                         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Autonomic Media Player – Premium`  | Advanced media control for Autonomic systems. Ideal for high-end AV control panels. |
| `Circle Slider`                     | A rotary-style slider. Useful for volume dials or lighting controls.       |
| `Clock`                             | Displays current time. Use in dashboards or control room interfaces.       |
| `DateTime`                          | Combines date and time selectors or display. Useful for scheduling screens.|
| `HTML Block`                        | Allows you to embed raw HTML content. Great for custom scripts or third-party widgets. |
| `Media Player`                      | A general-purpose player for embedded media content.                       |
| `Shades Control – Premium`          | Provides control UI for smart shades or blinds. Often used in home or conference room automation. |
| `Toggle Switch`                     | A stylized toggle for on/off functionality. Suitable for settings or device control. |

**When to Use Widgets:**

- Use `Clock`, `DateTime`, or `Media Player` in dashboards, automation panels, or meeting room UIs.
- Use `HTML Block` to embed weather widgets, custom branding, or third-party integrations.
- Use premium widgets like `Autonomic Media Player` or `Shades Control` when integrating specialized AV or building automation systems.

## Summary

Adding elements is a straightforward process:

Elements bring interactivity and structure to your containers, while widgets extend your design with powerful, reusable components.
