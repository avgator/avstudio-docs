The `Container options` panel allows you to configure how a specific container behaves and appears on the page. Whether you're adjusting layout or applying styles, this panel gives you precise control over container properties.

### 1. Container Friendly Name

This is the display name used to identify the container within the editor. Give it a clear and descriptive name to make your layout easier to manage.  
*Example: HeaderNav, SidebarPanel, ContentGroup*

### 2. Container CSS Classname

You can assign a CSS class to the container for styling purposes. This is helpful if you plan to apply custom CSS rules across multiple containers or use consistent class-based theming.

### 3. Layout Toggle by Orientation

This switch allows you to apply layout configurations per device orientation:
- Toggle between `All`, `Portrait`, and `Landscape`
- If disabled, settings apply uniformly regardless of orientation

### 4. Alignment

Expands to show alignment options for the container. You can control horizontal and vertical alignment relative to the parent or page layout.

### 5. Size

Lets you define the container's width and height, either in fixed values or percentages depending on layout needs.

### 6. Border

Customize the container’s border with:
- Thickness
- Color
- Radius (for rounded corners)

### 7. Background

Configure the background color or image used in the container. You can choose solid colors, gradients, or upload assets.

These container-level settings help you tailor each layout block’s appearance and behavior—especially when working with shared components or responsive positioning.

:::tip Note
When using multiple containers with similar roles (e.g., section headers), reuse class names and align settings to maintain consistency across your project.
