# Video

The `Video` element lets you embed and play videos directly in your AVStudio project. It supports static or dynamic sources, poster images, autoplay, mute, and layout/visibility controls.

**Summary:**  
This guide shows how to insert a `Video` element, connect a video file, configure poster and playback options, style it, add actions, and manage visibility/signals.

| `Dynamic` | Opens `Select datasource to work with` to link a data source. |

### Dimensions

| `Width` | Enter a fixed value or use `{-}` for a dynamic dimension. Units: `px`, `%`. |
| `Height` | Enter a fixed value or use `{-}` for a dynamic dimension. Units: `px`, `%`. |

### Mode selector by index or name

Customize poster, video source, and playback behavior.



### Poster image
Controls the placeholder image before playback.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `Library` | Select an image from the media library (`Pick image`). |
| `URL` | Enter an external image URL. |
| `Dynamic pick from library` | Enable to select the poster dynamically. |

### Video file URL
Defines the source video file.

- Enter a static URL or use `{-}` for a dynamic path.  
- Use the folder icon to browse media where available.

### Playback controls

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `AutoPlay` | Start playback automatically when loaded. |
| `Muted` | Start playback without sound. |
| `Hide All Controls` | Hide built-in player controls for a clean UI. |

---

## Design

Visual styling for the video container.


| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `Background color` | Choose a color or use `{-}` for a dynamic value. |
| `Border` | Toggle `Default` or `Override` to customize borders. |
| `Shadow` | Set to `None` or `Enabled`. |
| `Reflect` | Set to `None` or `Enabled` to add a reflection effect. |

---

## Actions

Define triggers and integrations (Crestron, variables, HTTP, etc.).

### Adding a new action

1. Click `Add new action`.  
2. The `Create new action for video` modal opens.  
3. Configure:  
   - `Name` — action name.  
   - `Behaviour` — when it triggers (e.g., `On Play`, `On Pause`, `On Change`).  
   - `Execution Delay` — delay in milliseconds (`ms`).  
4. Choose a target tab: `Crestron`, `Routing`, `Variables`, `Parameters`, `Overlays`, `Functions`, `HTTP Web Requests`, `Web Sockets`, or `Audio`.  
5. Under the selected tab, define fields such as `Type` and `Signal Name`, and choose `Push onChange Value` or `Push custom Value`.  
6. Click `Create action` to save.

## State

Manage visibility and disabled state.

### Visibility

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `Orientation visibility` | Show in `Both`, `Portrait`, or `Landscape`. |
| `Direct Value` / `Crestron FB` | Control visibility directly or via Crestron feedback. |
| `Visibility dynamic value` | Use `{-}` to bind visibility dynamically. |
| `Reserve space while hidden` | Keep layout spacing when hidden. |

### Disabled signal

Default label: `Now Always Enabled`.

## Key Points

- Use `Dynamic` dataset source and `{-}` bindings for data-driven videos.  
- Provide a lightweight poster image to improve perceived load speed.  
- Consider `Muted + AutoPlay` for silent, loop-style UI videos.  
- Hide controls for decorative or background video; keep them for user-driven playback.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Which video formats work best?**  
Use widely supported formats like MP4 (H.264/AAC). For cross-device reliability, host videos in a CDN and provide HTTPS links.

**Can I trigger actions when the video starts or pauses?**  
Yes. Add actions with `Behaviour` set to events like `On Play` or `On Pause`, then configure the target (e.g., `Crestron` or `HTTP Web Requests`).

**How do I change the poster image dynamically?**  
Enable `Dynamic pick from library` or bind the poster via `{-}` to a parameter/variable that updates at runtime.
