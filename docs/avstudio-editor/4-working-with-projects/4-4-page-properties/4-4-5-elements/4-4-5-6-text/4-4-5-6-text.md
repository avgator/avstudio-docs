# Text

The `Text` element allows you to display static or dynamic text content within your project. It supports flexible data binding, making it useful for both labels and dynamic data displays.

## Adding a Text Element

There are two ways to add a `Text` element:

* From the `Page Containers` section:

  * Open `Containers` and click `Add Element`.
  * The `New Element` window appears, where you can assign a `Name` and select the element `Type`.
  * Click the dropdown menu for `Type` and select `Text`.

* From the `Editor` page:

  * Right-click anywhere on the page.
  * Select `Add Element` from the menu.
  * The same `New Element` window will appear, allowing you to assign the element `Name` and select `Text` as the type.

After adding, you can configure the element’s properties as needed.

## Text Friendly Name

Click the edit icon (pencil) to make `Text Friendly Name` editable. Assign a name that helps identify the element easily within your project.

## Data Source

### Text Data Source

Choose whether the text is `Static` or `Dynamic`.

* `Static` displays fixed text content.
* `Dynamic` opens the `Select Data Source to Work With` window with a dropdown menu to pick an available data source.

### Size

Set `Width` and `Height` values for the text element.

* Units can be in `Pixels` or `Percentage`.
* Both width and height allow `Assign Dynamic Value`. Selecting the dynamic value icon `{-}` opens the `Pick Dynamic Value` window, where you can select `Variables`, `Parameters`, or `State` entries.

## Mode Selector by Index or Name

`Mode Selector by Index or Name` lets you switch between available text modes using either an index or a mode name.
- You can `Assign Dynamic Value`, represented by the `{-}` icon inside curly brackets.
- You can also `Assign Post-Processing Function`. Selecting this opens the `Select Post Processing Function` dropdown menu, where you can choose the desired function.

## Available Text Modes

By default, there is only the `Default` mode. You can add new modes by selecting the `+` icon. This opens the `Create New Text Mode` window, where you can:

- Set a `Name` for the new mode.
- Choose to `Copy from` the `Default` mode.
- Toggle `Separate actions for this mode` if you want distinct actions for the new mode.
- Click `Add New Mode` to create it.

## Text CSS Classname

The `Text CSS Classname` field is editable. You can enter a custom CSS class name to apply additional styling to the text element.

- You can `Assign Dynamic Value` to dynamically change the class name.
- You can also `Assign Post-Processing Function`, which opens the `Select Post Processing Function` dropdown menu to choose a function for modifying the value before it is applied.

## Sizing

`Sizing` defines the text size for the element.

- You can `Assign Dynamic Value`, which opens the `Pick Dynamic Value` window to select `Variables`, `Parameters`, or `State` entries, then save the changes.
- Text size units can be set to:
  - `px` (pixels)
  - `vh` (viewport height)
  - `bw` (baseline width)

## Icon

`Icon` allows you to attach an image icon to the text element for additional visual context.

### Use Image as Icon

When enabled, you can choose between two options: `Library` or `URL`.

After selecting an image, you can configure:
  - `Icon Size`
