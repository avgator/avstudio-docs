## 👉 By Dragging from the Toolbar

### Steps
1. On the right-hand side of the `Editor`, locate the **Elements Toolbar**.  
2. The toolbar shows element icons by default. If you prefer to view the element names, click the small arrow to expand the toolbar and display labels (e.g., **Text**, **Button**, **Slider**, **Image**).  
3. Find the element you want to add.  
4. Drag it from the toolbar onto the `Editor` workspace, then release to place it.  

📌 You can use this method on any page or subpage that opens in the `Editor`. It works for both responsive and adaptive pages.

## 📌 Key Points

- Use **Page Containers** for structured placement within container layouts.  
- Use the **Editor context menu** for faster additions to any active page.  
- Use **drag-and-drop** for visual positioning and layout refinement.  
- Newly added elements appear immediately in the `Editor` and property panel.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Can I add multiple elements at once?**  
No, elements must be added one at a time, but you can duplicate them after placement.

**Where do new elements appear by default?**  
They are added to the current container or active page within the Editor.

**Can I reorder or move elements after adding them?**  
Yes. Drag the element directly within the `Editor` or use the hierarchy panel.

## Summary

Add elements in three ways:

- From Page Containers (structured placement inside containers)
- From the editor’s context menu (quick insertion)
- By dragging from the elements toolbar (visual positioning)

Use whichever method best fits your current workflow; all elements appear immediately in the editor and properties panel.
