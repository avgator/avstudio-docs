# Main Dashboard Overview

The Main Dashboard is the first screen youâ€™ll see after logging into AVstudio. It gives you a snapshot of your projects, templates, and settings. This overview will walk you through each area of the interface so you can navigate and manage your work with confidence.

## â‘  Your Project List

This panel on the left displays the list of projects you've created â€” including their names and the total count.

ðŸ‘‰ Under `My Projects`, a number indicator shows how many projects are currently saved in your workspace.  
- Projects are listed underneath for quick access.  
- You can expand or collapse this section to keep things organized.

## â‘¡ Project Cards Area

The center of the page displays your projects as visual cards.

ðŸ‘‰ Each card shows:
- Project name  
- Last updated time and date  
- Last build (if any)  
- `Edit` icon to open the project  
- Hamburger icon for additional settings

This area provides a simple visual overview of all your saved work.

## â‘¢ Community Templates

This section offers pre-made templates shared by the AVstudio community to help you start faster.

ðŸ‘‰ These templates are ideal for quickly launching a project without building everything from scratch.  
- The number next to `Community Templates` indicates how many are currently available.  
- You can clone and fully customize these templates to suit your project needs.

This is one of the most helpful areas of the dashboard â€” whether you're prototyping, testing layouts, or just exploring ideas.

## â‘£ My Templates

If youâ€™ve built a project that works well and want to reuse it, you can save it as a personal template.

ðŸ‘‰ This section lists your saved templates (currently shows `My Templates [0]` if empty).  
- Perfect for maintaining consistent styles or replicating successful layouts.

Using personal templates is a simple way to speed up future projects.

## â‘¤ User Profile Menu

Located in the top right corner, this menu lets you manage your account.

ðŸ‘‰ Click the profile icon to:
- View your `Profile`  
- Switch or `Change Account`

This is especially useful if you're managing projects across multiple workspaces or roles.

## â‘¥ App Version Info

At the bottom left, you'll find version and release details.

ðŸ‘‰ The app version (e.g., `3.4.0`) helps you verify you're on the latest release â€” especially important for troubleshooting.  
It also includes links to AVstudioâ€™s social platforms and brand info.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

This is just an overview of the Main Dashboard. Weâ€™ll go into detail in other articles covering the rest of AVstudioâ€™s interface â€” including working with projects, sub-pages, global containers, variables, data sources, and more.
